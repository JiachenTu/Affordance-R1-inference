# Affordance-R1 & Qwen2.5-VL Video Understanding System

Comprehensive video understanding system with dual-model support: Affordance-R1 for affordance prediction and Qwen2.5-VL for general video grounding and captioning.

## Current Strategy: Two-Stage Task-Specific Frame Grounding

This system implements a rigorous two-stage approach to maximize both recall and precision in task-specific frame identification and object localization within video sequences.

### Stage 1: High-Recall Frame Extraction

The first stage prioritizes comprehensive coverage to ensure all potentially relevant frames are captured:

**Multi-Modal Sampling Strategy:**
- Systematic temporal sampling: Extract frames at fixed percentiles (5%, 15%, 25%, 35%, 50%, 65%, 80%, 95%) across video timeline
- VLM-guided detection: Use Qwen2.5-VL to identify timestamps where task-relevant objects are visible
- Dense sampling: Generate additional candidates within 10-second windows around detected events (2-second intervals)

**Quality Assessment:**
- Brightness evaluation: Reject frames that are too dark or overexposed (deviation from 127/255 brightness threshold)
- Contrast analysis: Filter frames with insufficient contrast (standard deviation < 64)
- Sharpness measurement: Apply Laplacian variance to eliminate blurry frames (threshold: 1000)

**Temporal Constraints:**
- Minimum 3-second spacing between selected frames to ensure temporal diversity
- Maximum 16 candidate frames per task to maintain computational efficiency
- Coordinate scaling factor calculation for downstream processing

### Stage 2: High-Accuracy Selection and Localization

The second stage focuses on precision through rigorous validation and precise object localization:

**VLM-Based Validation:**
- Task-specific evaluation criteria: Custom prompts containing 5 validation points per task
- Quantitative scoring: 1-10 scale assessment based on object visibility, interaction angle, and lighting conditions
- Contextual reasoning: Extraction of decision rationale from model responses
- Top-K selection: Rank all candidates and select 3 highest-scoring frames per task

**Precise Localization Pipeline:**
- Bbox extraction: Use Qwen2.5-VL with task-specific prompts to generate bounding box coordinates
- Interaction point identification: Extract precise pixel coordinates for human-object interaction
- Coordinate transformation: Apply scaling factors to map from processed to original image dimensions
- JSON parsing: Robust extraction handling malformed model outputs

**Segmentation and Visualization:**
- SAM2 integration: Generate pixel-level masks using extracted bounding boxes and points as prompts
- Multi-panel visualization: Create comprehensive displays showing original frame, detected objects, and segmentation masks
- Overlay generation: Combine masks with original images using transparency blending

## Usage

### Environment Setup
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
conda activate Affordance-R1
cd /home/jtu9/reasoning/Affordance-R1-inference/qwen_scripts
```

### Two-Stage Task Grounding Pipeline (Recommended)
```bash
# Complete pipeline processing all 11 tasks
python two_stage_task_pipeline.py \
  --video_path "/shared/BIOE486/SP25/users/ukd1/misc/testset_samples/421372/42445448/42445448.mp4" \
  --stage1_gpu 1 --stage2_gpu 2 --stage3_gpu 3

# Process specific task subset with custom parameters
python two_stage_task_pipeline.py \
  --video_path "video.mp4" \
  --tasks cabinet_top_left tv_remote_footrest power_outlet \
  --max_frames 12 --top_k 3 \
  --stage1_gpu 4 --stage2_gpu 5 --stage3_gpu 6
```

### Individual Stage Execution
For advanced users requiring granular control over each processing stage:

```bash
# Stage 1: High-recall candidate extraction
python enhanced_task_frame_extractor.py \
  --video_path "video.mp4" \
  --max_frames 16 \
  --gpu_id 1

# Stage 2: VLM-based validation and ranking
python vlm_frame_validator.py \
  --stage1_metadata "stage1_extraction_*.json" \
  --top_k 3 \
  --gpu_id 2

# Stage 3: Precise localization and segmentation
python task_bbox_processor.py \
  --stage2_metadata "stage2_validation_*.json" \
  --gpu_id 3
```

### Legacy Single-Stage System
```bash
# Single-pass frame identification (lower accuracy)
python task_frame_grounding.py \
  --video_path "video.mp4" \
  --gpu_id 1
```
